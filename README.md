Final essay


## Agency problems in TDFs
- TDF goal to reduce portfolio risk
- TDFs underperform balanced funds, especially where TDFs have fund-of-funds structure
- Agency problems arise from:
* inverstor inertia
* weak incentives for fund managers to outpergform peers
* opportunities for fund families to gain private benefits
- potential reason for agency problems:
* cashflows to funds don't respond to past performance
* investors fon't punish or reward good/bad performance, they don't withdraw funds
- TDFs popular retirement investment vehicles due to auto-enrolment of 401(k)
- pension plan participants are passive and lack financial literacy

## Are Target Date Funds Dinosaurs?
- Poor investment choices, adaptive investment strategies beat them
- Future pensioners long-term investors -> DC plan member can accumulate 30 yrs and decumulate another 20 yrs
- `Glide path` - in order to avoid sudden drops in DC portfolio, it is often suggested to use glide path strategy. Start risky with lots of equity, decrease when target date nears. Eg. take less risk when older, with less time to recover from market shock.

## Dynamic Lifecycle Strategies for Traget-Date Retirement Funds
- Dynamic asset allocation better than the determiistic switching rules
- `Lifecycle investing` - switching out of equities with time
- Deterministic TDFs optimal for some investors, not all
- Common argument: younger ppl should invest heavily in stocks, they have more time to recover from financial shocks
- TDFs don't quarantee anything
-Shiller (2005) typical regular contributors normally fixed % of salary
- Therefore: in thebeginning contributions are small and grow larger in later years. It could be beneficial to invest more in equity in later phase!
- Depends on investor's wealth accumulation objectives

## From Defined-Contribution Towards Target-Income Retirement Systems
- DC - risk is by individuals
- DC systems: don't tell the cost of financing each retirement dollar (at the time of retirement)
- DC systems tell the value of assets and/or past absolute return [TDFs too? Check]
- Optimal portfolio should hedge against interest rate risk with zero-coupon bond. Doesn't happen in reality. Maturity of bonds is almost constant, should decrease.
- TDF asset allocation strategy commonly: equity 100% - age of investor
- Optilan long term portfolio theory: portfolio of bonds with a duration matching as good as possible the investment horizon of investor. Doesn't happen in reality.

## Making Investment Choices as Simple as Possible, but Not Simpler
- many participants of self directed retirement plans [401(k)s]:
* do not know enough about investing to choose rationally among alternatives
* others (who have information) find it too unpleasant or time consuming
- TDFs are considered simple solution to these participants' needs
- TDF is a fund of funds, diversified among stocks, bonds and cash
- Feature of TDFs is the automatic reduction of proportion of stocks as time passes
- TDFs considered as improvement for uninformed plan participants
- `Human capital` - PV of future labor income declines as people age
- TDF strategy unoptimal, people have different risk aversion


## Optimal Asset Allocation for Retirement Saving: Deterministic vs. Time ...
- Optimal asset allocation for retirement portfolio: bond index and stock index
- Two types of strategies:
* `Deterministic` - based only on time remaining (eg. TDFs) until anticipated retirement date
* `Adaptive` - consider also the investor's accumulated wealth
- Adaptive strategies outperform deterministic ones
- (for intro) Long-term decline of DB
- DBs seen as high-risk liability for many organizations
- risk is being transferred to employees through DC plans
- (behavioral) `Automatic enrolment` and `automatic escalation`
- auto-enrollment: status quo
- auto-escalation: more contributions as salary goes up
- Pension Protection Act 2006
- Adaptive strategies in literature: statistical properties only, not tested for real
- good stuff for TDF concept

## Reducing Retirement Risk with a Rising Equity Glidepath
- Argue rising equity glidepath in retirement can yield better results
- They assume a scenario where first half has been bad (poor performance) and second half has good returns -> but equity exposure is low, missing chance for asset growth
- Sounds risky to me, what if there's market shock? Then it's like double-whammy
- (data analysis) U-shaped chart: equity in the beginning and the end low, in the middle high
- literature: Basu and Drew (2009)

## Target date funds: Can one just glide into retirement?
- TDFs have a glidepath portfolio, high risk equity weighted mix into more fixed-income weighting
- TDFs been growing
- TDF design: fund's mix of investments will automatically change so that it becomes more conservative as the target date approaches. Typically, from equities to bonds
- TDFs may have very different investment strategies and risk - even if they share the same target date
- Big losses to TDFs in 2008 crisis

## Target date funds in 401(k) retirement plans
- (behavioral) good stuff!
- Choice architecture:
* automatic enrollment
* re-enrollment
* fund mapping
- Participants may have little knowledge of finance, inertia
- TDFs been growing fast
- good stuff on TDF concept
- TDF features:
* `Portfolio repackaging` - contributions go to multi-asset class find-of-funds
* `Current portfolio allocation` - expected retirement age
* `Age-based rebalancing service` - risk exposure reduced as time goes by
- Reson for TDF's popularity: default-based choice architecture
- to be continued




# Other stuff
- litigation for poor performers
- current size/status of TDFs
- types of TDFs: end at retirement age, continue during retirement period
