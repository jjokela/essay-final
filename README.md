Final essay


## Agency problems in TDFs
- TDF goal to reduce portfolio risk
- TDFs underperform balanced funds, especially where TDFs have fund-of-funds structure
- Agency problems arise from:
* inverstor inertia
* weak incentives for fund managers to outpergform peers
* opportunities for fund families to gain private benefits
- potential reason for agency problems:
* cashflows to funds don't respond to past performance
* investors fon't punish or reward good/bad performance, they don't withdraw funds
- TDFs popular retirement investment vehicles due to auto-enrolment of 401(k)
- pension plan participants are passive and lack financial literacy

## Are Target Date Funds Dinosaurs?
- Poor investment choices, adaptive investment strategies beat them
- Future pensioners long-term investors -> DC plan member can accumulate 30 yrs and decumulate another 20 yrs
- `Glide path` - in order to avoid sudden drops in DC portfolio, it is often suggested to use glide path strategy. Start risky with lots of equity, decrease when target date nears. Eg. take less risk when older, with less time to recover from market shock.

## Dynamic Lifecycle Strategies for Traget-Date Retirement Funds
- Dynamic asset allocation better than the determiistic switching rules
- `Lifecycle investing` - switching out of equities with time
- Deterministic TDFs optimal for some investors, not all
- Common argument: younger ppl should invest heavily in stocks, they have more time to recover from financial shocks
- TDFs don't quarantee anything
-Shiller (2005) typical regular contributors normally fixed % of salary
- Therefore: in thebeginning contributions are small and grow larger in later years. It could be beneficial to invest more in equity in later phase!
- Depends on investor's wealth accumulation objectives

## From Defined-Contribution Towards Target-Income Retirement Systems
- DC - risk is by individuals
- DC systems: don't tell the cost of financing each retirement dollar (at the time of retirement)
- DC systems tell the value of assets and/or past absolute return [TDFs too? Check]
- Optimal portfolio should hedge against interest rate risk with zero-coupon bond. Doesn't happen in reality. Maturity of bonds is almost constant, should decrease.
- TDF asset allocation strategy commonly: equity 100% - age of investor
- Optilan long term portfolio theory: portfolio of bonds with a duration matching as good as possible the investment horizon of investor. Doesn't happen in reality.

## Making Investment Choices as Simple as Possible, but Not Simpler
- many participants of self directed retirement plans [401(k)s]:
* do not know enough about investing to choose rationally among alternatives
* others (who have information) find it too unpleasant or time consuming
- TDFs are considered simple solution to these participants' needs
- TDF is a fund of funds, diversified among stocks, bonds and cash
- Feature of TDFs is the automatic reduction of proportion of stocks as time passes
- TDFs considered as improvement for uninformed plan participants
- `Human capital` - PV of future labor income declines as people age
- TDF strategy unoptimal, people have different risk aversion
